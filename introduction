Artificial Life Creation Comparing Genetic Algorithms And Genetic Programming

Artificial Life
Artificial life or ALife is the study and implementation of systems that are simulations or replications of natural life. These systems can be biochemical, mechanical, computer software and many other medium that supports the existence of structured self controlled information. This report will be looking at software artificial life, or Soft ALife and how it can be implemented using evolutionary computation. Evolutionary computation has been used for the creation of artificial life for many decades, REF + EXAMPLE. Using evolutionary computation has many qualities that replicate naturally evolved life, and is one few computational methods known that can generate solutions to problems without human interaction. Evolutionary computation has been applied to artificial life to generate life forms that can inhabit an environment and are 'solutions' to this environment.

Evolutionary computation generally works by generating a population of solutions to a problem, and then using this population to create a better next population that can solve the given problem better. To create a better population crossover, mutation and selection are used in various forms to generate a fitter population. Each of these populations is refered to as a generation. Each member in the population is a solution to the problem, however these solutions do not have to be correct, and are often close to correct before many generations have passed. Each member of the population is assigned a fitness value to corespond
