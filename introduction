Artifical Life Creation Comparing Genetic Algorithms And Genetic Programming

Artificial Life
Artifical life or ALife is a the study and implementation of systems that are simulations or replications of natural life. These systems can be biochemical, mechanical, computer software and many othe medium that supports the existance of strucutured self controlled information. This report will be looking at software artificial life, or Soft ALife and how it can be implemented using evolutionary computation. Evolutionary computation has been used for the creation of artifical life for many decades, REF + EXAMPLE. Using evolutionary computation has many qualities that replicate naturally evolved life, and is one few computational methos
