			Programming (PDGP), a form of Genetic Programming (GP)
			which is suitable for the development of programs with
			a high degree of parallelism and an efficient and
			effective reuse of partial results. Programs are
			represented in PDGP as graphs with nodes representing
			functions and terminals, and links representing the
			flow of control and results. In the simplest form of
			PDGP links are directed and unlabelled, in which case
			PDGP can be considered a generalisation of standard GP.
			However, more complex representations can be used,
		which allow the exploration of a large space of
			possible programs including standard tree-like
			programs, logic networks, neural networks, recurrent
			transition networks, finite state automata, etc. In
			PDGP, programs are manipulated by special crossover and
			mutation operators which guarantee the syntactic
			correctness of the offspring. For this reason PDGP
			search is very efficient. PDGP programs can be
			execut...",

			This is the most complete account of PDGP and its
			performance so far. E.g. a symbolic regression problem
			x^6-2*x^4+x^2 in which PDGP does 16 times better than
			std GP and 13 times better than GP with ADFs.

					genetic programming paradigm, populations of computer
					programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian
					principle of survival of the fittest and using a
					genetic crossover (sexual recombination) operator
					appropriate for genetically mating computer programs.
					This chapter shows how to reformulate seemingly
					different problems into a common form (i.e. a problem
							requiring discovery of a computer program) and, then,
							  to show how the genetic programming paradigm can serve
								  as a single, unified approach for solving problems
								  formulated in this common way.",
